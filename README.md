  # Context
  "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" was inspired by the game featured in the show  **[The Big Bang Theory](https://the-big-bang-theory.com/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/)**. This game is an online virtual version of the hand gesture game spoke about on the show. The game is for all ages as you play against the computer. It will challenge you as the added twist of dropping a point if the player draws the same choice as the computer.

  The game is simple:
  - The game rules explain the button symbols for players who might of not heard of or played this variation of the game rock, paper, scissors.
  - Player chooses and option from the buttons displayed, rock, paper, scissors, lizard & spock.
  - The computer is set up to randomly choose an option, so results are different everytime.
  - If the player wins they are rewarded with one point.
  - If the player looses the computer is rewarded with one point.
  - If both the player and computer draw, both loose a point.
  - First to get to 10 points wins.
  - Then the player can restart the game or exit.

  As there are no extra levels to this game, I'v made it a bit more of a challenge by loosing a point with both player and computer draw the same. This adds lenght to the game, while also making the player think and choose with care which symbol they want to play next.

  ## Wireframes
![Wireframe](media/Wireframe.png)

I designed a basic wireframe first.This was to give me a template to follow and to make sure my original design that I had planned was the outcome and final layout of the application. The layout of the application is the same across all mobile, just resized to fit the device screen. 

## Design choices
### Background
My main objective for the background of the game was to be space themed as The Big Bang Theory has space and science references throughout the show and one of the symbols within the game "Spock" was a charater on Star Trek, another space themed show.
I needed the background to be complimentary and undistracting from the game. The background I chose came from **[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/qwoW4mdqjWw)** an amazing photograph of the Milky Way. 

### Colors
The colours I used to style elements within game came from with the background. I used eye dropper chrome extention, this allows you to accurately focus in on a colour from a webpage or document. This tool helped to pick colors from the background and tie the background in subtly throughout the game.
